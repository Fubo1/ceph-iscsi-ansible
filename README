This package installs the playbooks/tasks necessary to configure LIO gateways that provide a front-end to a ceph cluster.

The playbooks use custom modules that are just wrappers calling python modules installed on the gateways nodes. These
python modules handle the configuration interaction for;
- the gateway
- LUN's including RBD create and resize
- client definition
